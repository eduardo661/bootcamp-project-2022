                <li>Begin by perparing all of the indgrients that will be placed in the omelette.</li>
                <li> This includes: cutting up the onions, spinach, and mushrooms into small pieces</li>
                <li>Place some oil into a pan and cook the vegetables until they begin to smell.</li>
                <li>Afterwards, crack the three eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Continue by whisking the eggs until the yolk is no longer clearly visible.</li>
                <li>Heat up a thin layer of oil on a pan. Make sure there is enough oil present as we do not want the eggs to stick to the pan.</li>
                <li>Place your stirred eggs into the pan and allow them to cook for approximately 30 seconds. The eggs will begin to become solid. This is your cue to proceed to the next step.</li>
                <li> Add your previously cooked veggies into the center of the omelette in a straight line </li>
                <li>Now we have arrived at the most difficult step. Get a pair of tongs or a laddle and attempt to wrap one side of the omelette over the veggies in the middle to form a taco sort of shape.</li>
                <li>Flip the omelette onto the other side and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
